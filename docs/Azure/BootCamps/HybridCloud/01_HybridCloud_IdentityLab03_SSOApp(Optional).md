# Hybrid Identity Hands-On Lab

## Password single sign-on for an Azure AD gallery application

## Before you Begin

If you are using a Microsoft Azure subscription that was provided to you by Microsoft, you are limited to a specific set of Microsoft Azure regions that you can use. Please use either the **East US, South Central US, West Europe, Southeast Asia, West US 2, or West Central US locations**. Otherwise you will receive an  error in the portal if you select an unsupported region and attempt to build anything in Microsoft Azure.

## Overview

In this lab you are going to publish an application (Facebook) from the Azure AD Application Gallery to select users and configure password-based single sign-on. Azure AD will securely store and replay the  usernames and passwords for Facebook.
