# AZ-300: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies Study Group

The Microsoft OCP Scale Enablement Team is proud to facilitate this AZ-300 study group. It is designed to equip you for the recently refreshed Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies exam! 

## What are study groups?

Community-based deep technical sessions with an emphasis on experiential learning.  Participants will be assigned homework that includes both reading and hands-on activities that are directly aligned to exam objectives.  A private Yammer group is available for students to ask questions so that your growth stays on track during this fast-paced learning environment. We'll also meet once a week to review key elements of the exam objectives.

## What are the requirements?

Participants should complete the following prior to attending a study group:

- Azure Fundamentals Certification (or have equivalent knowledge)
- VILT training for the exam you wish to take
- Working Azure subscription (Visual Studio or IUR)

## Where do I register?

> Please note that you will be asked to confirm your registration for each study group.  Feel free to join as many as you want, just be mindful each study group requires 8-10 hours of homework per week.

## What is in this repo?

Simple ... Each file listed is a separate homework assignment, one for each of the exam objectives.
